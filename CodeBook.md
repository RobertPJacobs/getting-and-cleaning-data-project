## Transformations 

The zip file of source data can be found at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Transformations done:

1. The data was downloaded and unzipped 
1. The training and the test sets were merged to create one data set.
1. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement was extracted and other data ignored.
1. Name of the activities in the data set was converted to actual activities
1. Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names
1. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script.
